## Genuary 2021 - Daily Prompts for Generative Art

Generative Art that is based on daily prompts for the month of January 2021. Genuary 2021 was a collective project in which 100s of generative artists created art daily based on prompts that were given to them ahead of time. Below are my entries for this project.

***** 
## Prompts

A group of generative artists have collaborated and created a "prompt" for each day.
Click for the prompts for each day. [Here](https://genuary2021.github.io/prompts) are the actual prompts, but youâ€™re only supposed to do them on that particular day.

## Jan 17 
### Prompt: Draw a line, pick a new color, move a bit. 
[Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan17_Line_Color_Move/)

**Description** I constrained the lines to stay within one of 36 (6x6) panels. The colors rotate through a palette of colors. Each line (within a panel) is slightly longer that its previous one. Once the line length reaches the panel's dimension, it gets reset. Alternate the orientations to be vertical and horizontal in subsequent panels.

![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan05_Code_Golf/images/code_golf_251.png?s=400)

**Description** 
Randomly scatter colored balls, with increasing density closer to the "ground." Added connecting lines from the top to 3% of the balls, for a chandelier or suspended effect. The color of the balls is also dependent on their y-coordinate. Do the above, using 10 lines of code.

```
def setup():
    size(w, w)
    for _ in range(w):
        s, c = random(w), random(_)
        fill(c, c / 2, c / 4)
        flip = random(1)
        if flip > 0.97:
            line(w - s, 0, w - s, w - c)
        if flip > 0.8:
            ellipse(w - s, w - c - 20, r, r)
```
