## Genuary 2021 - Daily Prompts for Generative Art

Generative Art that is based on daily prompts for the month of January 2021. Genuary 2021 was a collective project in which 100s of generative artists created art daily based on prompts that were given to them ahead of time. Below are my entries for this project.

***** 
## Prompts

A group of generative artists have collaborated and created a "prompt" for each day.
Click for the prompts for each day. [Here](https://genuary2021.github.io/prompts) are the actual prompts, but youâ€™re only supposed to do them on that particular day.

## Jan 21
### Prompt: Recursion
```
function f(x) { 
    DRAW(x); 
    f(1 * x / 4); 
    f(2 * x / 4); 
    f(3 * x / 4); 
}
```

![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan21_Recursion/images/keep0.png?s=400)


**Description** Took the prompt literally and coded it. And then experimented with several DRAW functions and shapes, big and small. Added rotation to delineate the shapes.

*****

## Jan 20
### Prompt: No Loops
[Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan20_No_Loops/)
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan20_No_Loops/images/keep0.png?s=400)

**Description** No looping is allowed, so resorted to mainly using primitive shapes (triangles, rect, circles). Built on that to create "custom shapes," which also helps create the background shades. A few cut-and-paste operations for repeated shapes.

*****

## Jan 19
### Prompt: Increase the randomness along the Y-axis. 
[Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan19_Yaxis_Randomness/)
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan19_Yaxis_Randomness/images/keep0.png?s=400)

**Description** 
Start with a simple, clean sine wave, and progressively bring in more waves, adding noise and randomness, including rupturing the 
sine curve, all of which increase along the Y-axis.

*****

## Jan 18
### Prompt: One process grows, another process prunes.
[Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan18_Process_Growth_Pruning/)
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan18_Process_Growth_Pruning/images/keep0.png?s=400)

**Description** An attempt to convey 'growth and pruning' in one image, without resorting to animation. All my initial ideas involved animation. After some doodling, settled on this idea of alternating growth cycles with a pruning step. These concentric rings serve as pruning filters after each growth spurt. 

*****

## Jan 17 
### Prompt: Draw a line, pick a new color, move a bit. 
[Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan17_Line_Color_Move/)
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan17_Line_Color_Move/images/keep0.png?s=400)

**Description** I constrained the lines to stay within one of 36 (6x6) panels. The colors rotate through a palette of colors. Each line (within a panel) is slightly longer that its previous one. Once the line length reaches the panel's dimension, it gets reset. Alternate the orientations to be vertical and horizontal in subsequent panels.

*****

## Jan 16: Circles Only [Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan16_Circles_Only)
### Prompt: Circles Only
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan16_Circles_Only/images/keep0.png?s=400)

**Description** The core idea was to suggest squares, but by rendering only circles. So I ended up using a circle-packing algorithm. The only twist is that each circle (big or small) has to stay well within the bounding box, which are the squares.

*****

## Jan 15: Rules by Someone Else [Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan15_Rules_By_Someone_Else)
### Prompt: Let someone else decide the general rules of your piece.
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan15_Rules_By_Someone_Else/images/keep0.png?s=400)


**Description** Followed the rules of a "Mayan Color Square" laid out by Alfred Jensen. In a 11x11 grid, Jensen has laid out some rules for colors to follow. 21 different colors are used here, in two palettes of 10 colors each --
10 Hot colors and 10 cold colors. Drawn over a force field.

### Prompt: Curve Only.
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan08_Curve_Only/images/curves_4755.png?s=400)
**Description**  In a small grid, choose 2 points and draw several Bezier curves between them, varying each one slightly to create ripple effects. Rotate and reflect 4-way to create symmetrical curves.

*****
## Jan 07 Generate Rules - Hand Drawn [Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan07_Rules_and_Hand-drawn)
### Prompt: Generate some rules, then follow them by hand on paper.
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan07_Rules_and_Hand-drawn/images/attempt1.JPEG?s=400)
**Description** 

No code for today's prompt, just some doodling. Note: Instead of drawing on paper, I drew in on my tablet.
Here are the 3 Rules I used to create the image above:
1. Cover area with a single loop/line that never intersects itself.
2. Bonus points for uniform spacing
3. Bonus points for non uniform patterns.


*****
## Jan 06 Triangle Subdivision [Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan06_Triangle_Subdivision)
### Prompt: Triangle subdivision.
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan06_Triangle_Subdivision/images/ico_anim.gif?s=400)
**Description** 
Start with a 20-sided icosahedron. Subdivide each triangular face into smaller triangles. Project 
the vertices of all the resulting smaller triangles on to a sphere. Add rotation to spin along 2 of the spherical axes.

*****
## Jan 05 Code Golf [Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan05_Code_Golf)
### Prompt: Do some code golf! How little code can you write to make something interesting? Share the sketch and its code together if you can.
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan05_Code_Golf/images/code_golf_251.png?s=400)

**Description** 
Randomly scatter colored balls, with increasing density closer to the "ground." Added connecting lines from the top to 3% of the balls, for a chandelier or suspended effect. The color of the balls is also dependent on their y-coordinate. Do the above, using 10 lines of code.

```
def setup():
    size(w, w)
    for _ in range(w):
        s, c = random(w), random(_)
        fill(c, c / 2, c / 4)
        flip = random(1)
        if flip > 0.97:
            line(w - s, 0, w - s, w - c)
        if flip > 0.8:
            ellipse(w - s, w - c - 20, r, r)
```

*****
## Jan 04 Small Areas of Symmetry [Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan04_Symmetry)
### Prompt: Small areas of symmetry.
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan04_Symmetry/images/noise_symm_4209.png?s=400)
**Description** 
Used vector force fields (noise fields) to create a whole field of partciles. A handful of them 
are rotated to create small areas of symmetry.

*****
## Jan 03 Something Human [Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan03_Something_Human)
### Prompt: Make something human.
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan03_Something_Human/images/g25.gif?s=400)
**Description** 
Is it possible to show a wide gamut of emotions using only a few lines and curves? This is an attempt at a generative cartoon face, using proportions and geometry to generate "emotions."

*****
## Jan 02 Rule 30 [Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan02_Rule30)
### Prompt: Rule 30 (elementary cellular automaton)
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan02_Rule30/images/tile_alt_rule_30_7324.png?s=400)
**Description** 
A vanilla version of Rule 30 is used to create a base tile. All 0's are white but a rotating palette of colors is used for 1 (instead of the usual black). Finally, in a 4x4 grid, these tiles are rotated and rendered.

*****
## Jan 01 Triple Nested Loops [Code](https://github.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/tree/main/Jan01_Triple_Nested_Loops)
### Prompt: // TRIPLE NESTED LOOP
![with size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ram-N/Genuary_2021/main/Jan01_Triple_Nested_Loops/images/triple_loop1.png?s=400)
**Description** An attempt to get an image that didn't look too geometric. This code is simply 3 nested loops, with three index variables one for each loop. These variables dictate the color, stroke width, and size of the shapes (lines, ellipses). There are 3 "layers" with each layer progressively getting sharper and finer in resolution.
Loop 1: Using the variable for translate and rotate
Loop 2: Using it for x, y coordiates
Loop 3: Color, Line thickness, transparency (alpha)
