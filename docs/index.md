## Genuary 2021 - Daily Prompts for Generative Art

Generative Art that based on daily prompts for the month of January 2021. Genuary 2021 was a collective project in which 100s of generative artists created art daily based on prompts that were given to them ahead of time. Below are my entries for this project.

## Prompts

A group of generative artists have collaborated and created a "prompt" for each day.
Click for the prompts for each day. [Here](https://genuary2021.github.io/prompts) are the actual prompts, but youâ€™re only supposed to do them on that particular day.
