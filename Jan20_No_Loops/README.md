# Jan 20 - Prompt: No Loops.

Other images can be found [here](images)

## Description
No looping is allowed, so I resorted to mainly using primitive shapes (triangles, rect, circles). Built on that to create "custom shapes."
A few cut-and-paste operations for repeated shapes.

- The Code can be [found here](.)

## Code and Common Modules
`noloops.py` is what you have to run to recreate these images.
Run this from _inside_ the Processing IDE, since it uses Processing.


For most of these, I am using the `Processing` Framework. Since I mostly code in Python, I use [the Python extension of Processing](https://py.processing.org/reference/), which is not as popular as its Java version. Also, I sometimes create small resuable code segments which I use in multiple projects. I'm sharing all my genart code, in case others find it useful.
