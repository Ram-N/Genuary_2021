## Prompts

A group of generative artists have collaborated and created a "prompt" for each day.
Click for the prompts for each day. [Here](https://genuary2021.github.io/prompts) are the actual prompts, but youâ€™re only supposed to do them on that particular day.

## Project Structure

For each day that I attempt to create something, I hope to follow this structure
- Art artifact (jpeg, png or gif)
- A brief description of the end product, and possibly the thinking behind it
- Some technical notes and challenges
- Code
- References, if any

## Code and Common Modules

For most of these, I am using the `Processing` Framework. Since I mostly code in Python, I use [the Python extension of Processing](https://py.processing.org/reference/), which is not as popular as its Java version. Also, I sometimes create small resuable code segments
which I use in multiple projects. I'm sharing all my genart code, in case it is useful to others.
